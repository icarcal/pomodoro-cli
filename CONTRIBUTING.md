# Contributing

:+1::tada: First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! :tada:

Pull requests are always welcome and greatly help the project to grow. 
The purpose of this guide is to maintain code quality and ensure that we are following all the steps before merge.
These are mostly guidelines, not rules. Use your best judgment, and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.

## Development

- Fork the project;
- Create a branch in the project that you fork;
    - [Use git-flow pipeline ] (https://danielkummer.github.io/git-flow-cheatsheet/index.pt_BR.html)
- Make changes to this branch and at the end open PR referencing this repository;

### O que **n√£o** fazer
- Develop into ** master **.
- Do not merge until code is reviewed.
- Do not merge before all discussions have ended.

## Commits

- Make small commits that describe unique changes.
- Follow the references on writing commit messages:
    - [_Commit Guidelines_](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Distributed-Git-Contributing-to-a-Project#_commit_guidelines)
    - [_How to Write a Git Commit Message_](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)
- Use the body of the message for further explanation.

## Issues

- Describe what the problem is;
- If possible, give ideas and suggestion on how to solve the problem;
- Use links, image and references to be very clear and succinct;
